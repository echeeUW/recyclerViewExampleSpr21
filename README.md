# RecyclerView Example Spr21
Sample Project to show off how to build a scrolling with using RecyclerView & Adapters

### RecyclerView:
1. Added the RecyclerView to the activity layout: <br>
[activity_main.xml](https://github.com/echeeUW/recyclerViewExampleSpr21/blob/main/app/src/main/res/layout/activity_main.xml)

2. Created a view for each list item:<br>
[item_person](app/src/main/res/layout/item_person.xml)

5. Created the adapter to load the data into each list item:<br>
[PeopleAdater.kt](app/src/main/java/edu/uw/echee/recyclerviewexamplespr21/PeopleAdapter.kt)

4. Here is where we set the adapter to the RecyclerView: <br>
[MainActivity.kt](app/src/main/java/edu/uw/echee/recyclerviewexamplespr21/MainActivity.kt)
